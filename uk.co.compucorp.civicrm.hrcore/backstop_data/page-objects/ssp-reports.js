   * (the iframe would not resize consistently every time, leading BackstopJS to
   * report height differences of a handful of pixels)
   *
   * In order to avoid false positives, the height of the iframe is fixed
   * by applying a generated-on-the-fly style to it, so that the height can't
   * change when Chrome resizes the viewport.
